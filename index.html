<p>We here at Nthusiast truly appreciate the marvel bestowed to society that is the internet. The world has never been closer. It is unfortunate however, to look at corporations make the most of user data. We believe the user to be the consumer and not corporation. The embodiment of free thought, collaboration and discussion are fundamental principles we believe in, a vision we hope to share with you.</p>

</h2>
<p>Nthusiast exists to connect you with the people that not only share a common love for your hobby or interest, but also possess as deep an understanding &amp; passion for it as you.</p>
<p>Nthusiast is for every banker who follows F1 races, for every store manager that’s secretly a football fanatic, every store salesman that discreetly places cricket bets from the changing room, every grandmother that’s more politically insightful than the news anchors we see on tv.
Nthusiast is for the connoisseurs, the “madmen”, and the ignored talents of the world.
Nthusiast is for your forgotten dreams.</p>
<h2>
<a id="vision-statement" class="anchor" href="#vision-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link header-color"></span></a><strong>Vision Statement</strong>
</h2>
<p>Nthusiast aims to connect millions across the world to their calling, and the people that understand it. We aim to venture beyond just the domain of the normal social media app and become a part of how people live their lives and pursue their dreams with specialised services and specialised connectivity.
Every man, woman and child has an inner calling, that Nthusiast is ready to answer by equipping them to live up to their potential and tap on their talent through a positive feedback loop with other knowledgeable people in the field.
Nthusiast envisions a social media environment of specialisation where people that are from varied socio - cultural and economic backgrounds can co operate, because they are connected by their passion for their sphere of interest; and ordinary people can come together to do extraordinary things.</p>
