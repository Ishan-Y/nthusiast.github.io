{"name":"Nthusiast - Android","tagline":"This is the development repository for Nthusiast, an open source platform for topic-driven discussion!","body":"# **Nthusiast**\r\n \r\nThis is the development repository for Nthusiast's Android application. [First commit on 4:04AM 20/03/2020]\r\n\r\nWe here at Nthusiast truly appreciate the marvel bestowed to society that is the internet. The world has never been closer. It is unfortunate however, to look at corporations make the most of user data. We believe the user to be the consumer and not corporation. The embodiment of free thought, collaboration and discussion are fundamental principles we believe in, a vision we hope to share with you.\r\n\r\n## **Privacy Policy**\r\n\r\nNthusiast values upholds privacy of its users to the highest pedestal. Our application, by virtue of its open source nature open displays all of its data collection practices as is. Listed below are some of the practices taken by our company in order to ensure privacy of its user.\r\n- Sign-in methods are limited to manual sign-in only in order to ensure data containerisation.\r\n- Saved user preferences are limited to joined dorms.\r\n- All advertisements and promoted posts are sent to consumers on the basis of dorm feed.\r\n- Adverstisement requests are API driven with anonymised tokens preventing preference leaks.\r\n\r\n## **Licensing** \r\n\r\nThe app has no license. While the code is source readable, it is not an open source software. Please check LICENSE for further details.\r\n\r\n## **Mission Statement**\r\n\r\nNthusiast exists to connect you with the people that not only share a common love for your hobby or interest, but also possess as deep an understanding & passion for it as you.\r\n\r\nNthusiast is for every banker who follows F1 races, for every store manager that’s secretly a football fanatic, every store salesman that discreetly places cricket bets from the changing room, every grandmother that’s more politically insightful than the news anchors we see on tv.\r\nNthusiast is for the connoisseurs, the “madmen”, and the ignored talents of the world.\r\nNthusiast is for your forgotten dreams.\r\n\r\n## **Vision Statement**\r\n\r\nNthusiast aims to connect millions across the world to their calling, and the people that understand it. We aim to venture beyond just the domain of the normal social media app and become a part of how people live their lives and pursue their dreams with specialised services and specialised connectivity.\r\nEvery man, woman and child has an inner calling, that Nthusiast is ready to answer by equipping them to live up to their potential and tap on their talent through a positive feedback loop with other knowledgeable people in the field. \r\nNthusiast envisions a social media environment of specialisation where people that are from varied socio - cultural and economic backgrounds can co operate, because they are connected by their passion for their sphere of interest; and ordinary people can come together to do extraordinary things.\r\n\r\n## **Contributing, Feature Request & Issues**\r\n\r\nGuidelines for the same are outlined on their seperate .md files - check them out!\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
